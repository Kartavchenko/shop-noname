# Pet project **Shop**

Shop is a simple e-commerce web application that allows users to browse and purchase a range of products. This project is built using React.js and relies on a fake API for product data. Using Redux Toolkit for state management and Firebase for user authentication. For saving data in the database, I used Firebase.

_The project is a work in progress and will be updated with additional features in the future._

**Features:**

1. Logining and registration user account with Firebase.
2. User page.
3. Product page with pagination.
4. Search product by name.
5. Add product to card.
6. Remove product from card.
7. History of orders. _(using firebase to save data)_
8. Wish list. _(in progress)_
